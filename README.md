# Image Morphing

## Overview

* Find keypoints in image
* Implement the delaunay triangulation for the points
* Transform the image w.r.t the triangle

## How many kepoints are identified?
68 facial keypoints

## How to run the model?

git clone git@github.com:selvakannanjr/dl_image_morphing.git
cd face-morphing-multiple-images
python code/main.py --folder aligned_images --output video_output.mp4 --duration 4
```
